# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** February 17, 2024, 10:00 AM - February 17, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The web application experienced a 30-minute outage, affecting 15% of users. Users encountered HTTP 500 errors and timeouts, leading to loss of service availability.
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which resulted in uneven distribution of traffic to backend servers.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in HTTP 500 errors.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineering team notified of the issue via monitoring dashboard.
- **10:10 AM:** Investigation initiated, focusing on backend servers and database connectivity.
- **10:20 AM:** Initial assumption made that database issues were causing the errors. Database team alerted for assistance.
- **10:30 AM:** Database team confirmed no issues with database connectivity or performance.
- **10:40 AM:** Further investigation revealed load balancer misconfiguration.
- **10:50 AM:** Incident escalated to senior DevOps engineers for resolution.
- **11:20 AM:** Load balancer settings corrected, traffic evenly distributed across backend servers.
- **11:30 AM:** Service fully restored, users no longer experiencing errors.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** Misconfiguration in load balancer settings resulted in uneven distribution of traffic, overwhelming some backend servers while leaving others underutilized.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across all backend servers, ensuring balanced workload distribution and preventing server overload.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated configuration validation checks for load balancer settings.
  - Enhance monitoring alerts to detect load balancer configuration anomalies.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Develop automated scripts to validate load balancer configurations.
  2. Conduct load balancer configuration review to ensure alignment with best practices.
  3. Enhance monitoring system to detect and alert on load balancer configuration changes.
  4. Schedule regular load balancer maintenance checks to prevent future misconfigurations.

This postmortem outlines the details of the recent web stack outage, its root cause, resolution steps, and proposed corrective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. By implementing the listed tasks, we aim to enhance system reliability and minimize downtime impact on our users.
